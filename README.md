The goal of this project is to provide accurate, up-to-date, and easily accessible information for the Devon RFU Colts league. It's meant to replace a manual tracking with a centralized system that automatically updates standings based on submitted results.

### Target Audience
*   **Public:** Players, Coaches, Parents, and Supporters.
*   **Administration:** Club Administrators (reporting scores) and Devon RFU Officials (monitoring the league).
